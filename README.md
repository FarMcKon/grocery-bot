# Grocery Bot for SMS

A very simple tool to accept SMS messages and process them into a grocery list. Just text it, it saves and shares it, and you can list it later. 

Main use: 
- 'add <items-to-add>' to add an item to the grocery list
- 'show'  to list all items, 
- and finally 'clear' to clear it.

## Features
- Create and manage grocery lists
- Add, remove, and update items

## Sign-up !
